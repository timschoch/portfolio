        <p>The reason why building usable stuff makes me so happy is because I love to help others. I care about others achieving their goals and having a good time while doing so. To design usable products I put myself in the shoes of the user and take over their view. The Double Diamond process shown in the graphic above is a way of tackling projects in an informed manner and was created by <a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank">The British Design Council</a>. In short it aims to first understand before implementing a solution. You can find an excellent summary on it over at <a
        href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/double-diamond" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a>.</p>
        <p>In terms of UX methods I use <strong>Interviews</strong>, <strong>Personas</strong>, <strong>Field Studies</strong>, <strong>Design Workshops</strong> and <strong>Brainstorming</strong> to gather knowledge.</p>
        <p>With that understanding I use <strong>Story Boarding</strong>, <strong>Card Sorting and Tree Testing</strong>, <strong>Wireframes and Mockups</strong> and <strong>Low-Fi Prototypes</strong> in <strong>Lab Studies</strong> to propose practical solutions.</p>
        <p>During the implementation I <strong>design the Interface</strong>, keep <strong>in touch with the devs</strong> and test <strong>High-Fi Prototypes</strong> in <strong>Lab Studies</strong>.</p>
        <p>Because I rarely get the freedom (read: budget) to run a perfect all-inclusive UX scenario I choose which methods will provide the best results with a reasonable effort depending on the type of project, the scale and the budget. With smaller projects I might just do a stakeholder interview, a short persona workshop and a Lab Study on the current intranet while bigger projects will have prototypes, can be iterative and I usually try to steer those client towards agile methods instead of a single big bang release.</p>
        <p>You can find more on how I apply these methods in practical work examples provided in the next chapter:</p>

                Our Client was looking to build a versatile extranet where existing and potential clients as well as service technicians on site could access their product catalogue, documentation, training and collaboration workspaces.<br />
                What looked like a simple task in the beginning turned out to be way more complex due to very different persona requirements.

            <h4>Assignment</h4>
            <p>Landis+Gyr is the global industry leader in metering solutions for electricity, gas, heat/cold and water and a pioneer in the field of smart grids. They tasked us with developing a concept for an extranet where their clients can collaborate and exchange documents in workspaces, access the product catalogue and get further information or software updates. Our goal with the UX Study was to create a basic understanding of how the extranet would flow and what areas needed further investigation during the actual project. The UX time budget was roughly a week.</p>
            <h4>Kick Off Workshop</h4>
            <p>The first workshop was used to understanding the client's needs, map out what content the extranet would have and create the user stories. Also in this first day we created about a dozen personas and prioritized them for release one. At some point it got very clear that this extranet will include a lot more roles than the client had expected and that it would be a complex task to create platform that meets these very divergent requirements and is easy to use.</p>
            <h4>Basic Mockups</h4>
            <p>Early on I created some very basic mockups. They acted more as a discussion starter in the second workshop than an actual deliverable and proved to be very helpful as the client could visualize and understand how screen estate is managed. The wireframes below show a layout concept for the workspaces.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/lundg/wireframes.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>On the <strong>left</strong> you can see the first attempt at role based content as it would show different actions to internal or external users.<br />
              The <strong>right</strong> side shows the home page of a single workspace and its overview page - nothing too spectacular there except for the short introductory video on how to use workspaces. This level of on boarding is actually quite rare on intranets.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
            <p>After the content map was sorted out and the wireframes where done I created a paper prototype. It consisted of roughly 20 screens, each with its own various bits and pieces that could be altered using post-it notes. Between each participant we discussed the findings and iterated on parts of the prototype.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/lundg/paper-prototype.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>I acted as the computer changing the paper screen in front of the user while the rest of the team was observing and taking notes.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Role Based Navigation</h4>
            <p>The personas where split into two groups with fundamentally different requirements regarding how they use products. On one side there where personas that had access to a lot of the products (100+) and would use a wide number of them in their daily work. A typical role for this persona would be an internal project manager or a sales manager.</p>
            <p>On the other hand there are a lot of users who only have access to a limited amount of products (10 to 30). Out of those only a subset would be relevant to them on a daily basis. This holds true for technical support staff maintaining the products on site.</p>
            <p>I created a mockup of a personalized mega menu showing different quick access lists depending on the users' needs.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/lundg/contextual-navigation.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>Role based mockups for the mega menu showing different quick access lists for internal or external users.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
            <p>On the desktop (left) the highest priority personas are equally interested in the product information itself (column one and two) as in the related content like spec files or related software. As a result screen estate is evenly shared.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/lundg/responsive.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>The two layouts show how the second column containing the product description gets a lot more space on the desktop (left) then on the mobile page (right).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>On the mobile view (right) the product information (#two) is collapsed to only a couple of lines of teaser text because that information isn't as relevant to the highest priority mobile users (the technical staff on site). Progressive disclosure is used for the description as well as the additional resources.</p>
            <p>These are critical gas and electricity items it is important the user working on them select the right manuals and spec sheets. By only showing the product name, product number and images above the fold it is more likely the users visually confirms that the physical product he or she is currently working on match. We could have rearranged the additional resources on mobiles show above the fold, but forcing the user to scroll slows them down enough to actually read the title and have a look at the image before opening a manual.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>I've seen this on several occasions that a UX study was thought to be a quick validation of a concept or wireframe but instead surfaced deeper challenges and required more research to be solved. In my opinion field or lab studies should be a part of every requirements engineering process.</p>

                As part of a PoC for a Document Management System I conducted a field study that surfaced unexpected findings.
                Based on those we created wireframes and used them in a Usability Test.<br />
                Programming the proof of concept was a lot more streamlined because of the UX deliverables.

          <div class="details">
            <h4>Assignment</h4>
            <p>Our client is a prime contractor in the real estate industry and their SharePoint intranet and collaboration platforms where rarely used despite good training efforts and as a result lacked a common way of handling documents. Our task was to proof if SharePoint could be used to build a useful DMS. As the first attempt had failed usability was a main focus.</p>
            <p>Our study consisted of a two day field study to understand the document life cycle throughout the different departments and another two days conducting a lab study using a paper prototype. Due to the summer holidays approaching the time frame was only two weeks from the first day of the study to the finished report. Because of this we used a lean approach where findings where saved as PBIs and in a basic requirements list. Our final deliverable was a full backlog and a common understanding on the project team, summarized in a very short report mainly focusing on high level findings both for the current and further releases.</p>

            <h4>Kick Off Workshop</h4>
            <p>We collaboratively created the personas using lean characters, set out a road map for the studies and selected 18 test users from all departments and ages. We had a permanent team consisting of the project managers and myself plus additional members (information architect and our lead developer) that accompanied us for at least one day during the study.</p>
            <p>The two main personas we created where the "dossier internal" and the "dossier external" user. The first is mainly working within a few dossiers and has a deep knowledge of them (real estate agents or construction site supervisors) while the second uses a wide variety of dossiers but with a shallow and very specific subset of folders (marketing or team leaders).</p>

            <h4>Field Study</h4>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/mueag/field-study.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>E-Mails and printed documents play a crucial role in this client's document handling.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We spent two days observing the users working with documents and interviewed them on the current document life cycles. The results were interesting to say the least: E-Mail and MS Outlook where the main way of handling digital files. Users would send E-Mails back and forth and keep copies of often used documents in their inbox or save them locally. Of course a lot of those copies weren't up do date anymore. Some of the teams would print out all relevant information and store them in binders specific to the property they belong to.</p>
            <p>Now you might think this is a very unsecure way to handle important data. But after a closer look it was just the most efficient way to both collaborate and keep track of the tasks at hand. The inbox and calendar functioned as the to-do list, while the important documents got saved to a mail folder and could easily be accessed and searched form a single interface. As a property was usually assigned to only a single person the printed out paper was a very fast and intuitive way of skimming through a large set of content.</p>

            <h4>Analyzing the field study</h4>
            <p>The key insights where that file handling, template management and the search needed major improvements. After two days we knew that we had to come up with a very good solution to outperform the current methods. <br/>After all - <strong>our tool had to beat Windows Explorer</strong>.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/mueag/workshop.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>We used affinity diagramming to distil the findings into a lot of post it notes</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Because it was impossible to make our tool faster (less clicks) then Windows Explorer we had to add real value in order to make our users happy and drive user adoption. Our solution combines a new process based information architecture with an optimized template management and an enhanced UI.</p>
            <p>Every dossiers has a single known state within the business process map and document templates related to it. By enhancing the <strong>[add new]</strong> button we not only show a selection of document types (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) but suggest the actual documents used in the current state. By allowing the user to choose the actual document they wouldn't have to be bothered with the rather abstract concept of a document template at all.</p>
            <p>If you wish you can take this even one step further and add some automatization to the dossiers. Milestone documents like a final protocol could trigger actions. This wasn't part of the scope for this project, but it is important to have a vision: how about a dashboard showing all the project states and what mile stones are missing before a project can proceed to the next phase. Or once the final protocol was added send marketing a notice that the real estate will become available on the market within the next six months so they can start to prepare the sales material.</p>

            <h4>Paper prototype lab study</h4>
            <p>Do you remember how we observed users flicking through binders full of printed documents during the field study? A lot of the daily work is comparing invoices and requests to protocols and contracts. For the paper prototype we designed a three column layout where each column serves the same dedicated purpose throughout the UI.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/mueag/prototype.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>A sketch of the three columns <strong>navigation</strong>, <strong>files</strong> and <strong>preview</strong></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> users select the dossier and subfolders, making use of a pattern they already know from Windows Explorer.</li>
              <li><strong>Files:</strong> lists files matching the current navigation selection. Inline search and filters allow the user to narrow down the list.</li>
              <li><strong>Preview:</strong> large preview of selected file allows users to quickly skim through digital documents without actively having to open the files. <strong>This is added value over Windows Explorer right here!</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <!--<p>Another features is a naming assistant that automatically updates timestamps. If a user duplicates the file "2015-04 construction site protocol.docx" it suggests "<strong>2016-07</strong> construction site protocol.docx". The same works when the users creates a new file where it would combine the current date with the file name specified in the process map.</p>-->
            <p>During the study we had a one hour break after each participant to iterate on the prototype. But because we had done a thorough job in the field study and when designing the prototype most of the participants where so successful at completing the tasks we had a hard time finding parts we could further improve.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/mueag/mueag.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>Myself, the client project manager and our lead dev working on the prototype (ltr) between sessions.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We did however add another persona as we felt sporadic users had very different needs from our two main personas and needed to be catered for separately.</p>

            <h4>Annotated Mockups</h4>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/mueag/mockups.png" alt="">
              <figcaption>The green blobs describe parts of the interface that will be included in the PoC while the orange ones aren't.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>After conducting the two studies I felt our developers would greatly benefit from detailed mockups showing the layout and interactions. I got an extra two days approved by the client and we used the expanded mockups in conjunction with a requirements list to define the final scope of the proof of concept.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>The most challenging part about this project was the very short time frame that forced us to really focus on this one project and work some night shifts too. This is rather unusual as most client's project managers have other duties as well and thus can't put such a concentrated effort into a single project. It definitely helped that we had a great C-Level commitment and they were very supportive in getting us the users we needed in such a short time.</p>

            <p>Our client is a canton department (canton is what we call a state in Switzerland) that has several divisions. Most of them operate semi-autonomous where they do get general governance and best practices but the implementation is mostly left to the departments. This was very obvious on the old intranet as the quality of content ranged from almost blank pages to really helpful and graphically enhanced sites. Our task was to create a report for the c-level management and consult them on how to build a new and usable intranet.</p>
            <p>We agreed on doing a Lab Study on the current intranet, draw a prototype and then test it. I did a quick post study interview and label test. Finally I conducted an expert Review. The budget for this project was roughly two weeks.

            <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
            <p>Most of the users with more than a year on the job had a good idea of what information and documents the different departments provided. Despite this shared understanding the inconsistent navigation across divisions made it hard to know how to access the documents. This lead to users saving templates locally or interrupting colleagues to ask for information.</p>
            <p>Also the most common document type labels where ambiguous (directives, guideline, form, processes, check lists).
              <ol>
                <li>No participant could tell the difference between <strong>directive, guideline and forms</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Process</strong> was correctly attributed to some form of operation or action, but it was unclear if this would be a diagram showing the process, a checklist of requirements for a given process, a documentation helping to apply the process or a workflow that could be started using a web form.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Based on the present content we recommended limiting the document types to <strong>directive, form and check list</strong> and a simplified site navigation:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>[Division Name]</strong> the landing page of the respective division</li>
              <li><strong>Documents</strong> contains all documents with quick filters on directives, forms and check lists</li>
              <li><strong>Process</strong> has a short explanatory text and three areas:
                <ul>
                  <li>List of workflows that can be started from here</li>
                  <li>Link to the Checklists view in the document library</li>
                  <li>Link to Provis (3rd party process management tool containing Visio process maps)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>The two main personas are called <strong>internal</strong> and <strong>external</strong>. Internal meaning they work in the same division as the page they are currently looking at and external. Both have different expectations on what the intranet should provide.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Division internal</strong> users have in-depth knowledge of the available documents and workflows offered by their division and will work directly on the document library. As they tend to use a hand full of templates over and over again we offer them a way to favorite documents on their intranet cockpit.</li>
              <li><strong>Division external</strong> users have rather shallow knowledge of what exact documents are available and only a general idea of where that document could be located or what the exact name might be. They need assistance in finding it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the next two examples I would like to demonstrate how this insight affected the final outcome.</p>

            <h4>Division home page</h4>
            <p>
              Each divisions landing page acts as an informational starting point and is optimized for <strong>external</strong> users. It answers the most important questions:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/jsd/homepage.png" alt="" />
            </figure>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>What service does this division provide?</strong><br />
                A brief introduction to the division. All sub-divisions in the text are directly linked to their respective landing page. This is something we added after observing a user trying to click on one of the sub-divisions in the text instead of the left navigation. It is a small detail but it adds to the convenience of using the intranet.</li>
              <li><strong>What are the most used assets?</strong><br />
                Each division can provide up to six links to their most important artefacts like documents, workflows or forms.</li>
              <li><strong>Where can I get help?</strong><br/>
                If the user is uncertain where to find the desired information they can quickly see who the main contact for that division is.</li>
              <li><strong>What is new?</strong><br />
                The latest news are shown here.<br/>(e.g. the fire department has bought new trucks)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Personal Cockpit</h4>
            <p>This is default browser home page that will be set by IT for every employee.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/jsd/cockpit.png" alt="">
              <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>The "me" column</strong>: customizable list that shows favorited content, an overview of all collaboration workspaces and workflows the user is part of. This is targeted at <strong>internal</strong> users granting quick access to well-known content.</li>
              <li><strong>Live search</strong> is directly integrated into the dashboard</li>
              <li>The default search result is a list of <strong>most used documents and forms</strong> covering the entire department. This part of the dashboard is optimized for <strong>external</strong> users by helping to discover content.</li>
              <li>The <strong>news column</strong> is used for both top down communication as well as news from within the divisions.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>In the final report the <strong>highest priority issues</strong> where <strong>soft skills</strong>. Things like change management, user on-boarding, committing to the intranet as an important tool and dedicating resources to that. Without a doubt "technical" proposals like the new cockpit will have their impact too, but without c-level commitment to keep the intranet up to date an intranet won't succeed.</p>

            <h4>Assignment</h4>
            <p>I joined IOZ as a web designer and developer initially and all the designs where created from scratch each time a client would order one. A complex and usability optimized design could take several weeks to produce. If you ever had to style SharePoint you know it's a pain. The CSS selectors can be so specific that a selector to override the link color in the navigation can end up like this:</p>
            <blockquote class="light">#s4-workspace div.ms-core-listMenu-verticalBox > ul.ms-core-listMenu-root.static li.static.selected > span.static:hover</blockquote>
            <p>As you can imagine re-creating this every time required a lot of in-depth know how and was very error prone. To mitigate this I built a SCSS framework for easy customization without the need to know any of the CSS selectors at all. Using gulp to build the design all our developers can now produce a decent looking design in under an hour. Compare that to the time it took us to previously complete a single design of the same quality and detail that is bloody fast.</p>
            <p>To further improve quality I built <strong>three templates</strong> to choose from. They are already UX optimized, cater to different CI styles and are so flexible we even use them as a boilerplates for custom designs. In the example below you can compare the three templates.</p>

            <p>Following are some client designs we built. All of them are based on one of the three templates showing the flexibility that comes with this framework.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>SharePoint used to be a usability mess with multiple UI concepts clashing everywhere. By making SharePoint behave more like a website and adhering to well-known conventions we made our intranets both easier to use and better looking. I'm glad to see that Microsoft has finally heard our requests for a better user experience and is overhauling the UI in their new products.</p>

        <p>Currently based in Lucerne, Switzerland, I'm a UX Specialist and Designer at <a href="http://www.ioz.ch" target="_blank">IOZ AG</a> where we build custom SharePoint Platforms and Add-Ins. As I'm the only one doing this sort of work my responsibilities range from <strong>producing custom Designs</strong> in Photoshop to <strong>planning and facilitating UX studies and workshops</strong> with our clients and introducing and <strong>establishing the UX principles</strong> with the various stakeholders within our company.</p>
        <p>I've been floating through the web cosmos since the age of 14 (that's more than half of my life) as a graphic designer, front and backend developer and currently as a UX specialist. Throughout my career I've been interested in building easy to use products and prioritizing the user's needs.</p>
        <p>Back in the days that was an unusual view as things just had to work to be approved by clients. So once UX gained traction I finally found a name (or methodology) to express my desires and since I have focused on this creative yet analytic discipline.</p>
        <p>On a more personal note: I'm married to my lovely Wife Silvia and I'm a father of two sweet little princesses. I try to spend most of my free time with them and together we enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/overlandfamily/" target="_blank">exploring Switzerland<i class="fa fa-instagram icon"></i></a>. Every now and then I get to be <a href="https://500px.com/timschoch" target="_blank">creative with my camera<i class="fa fa-500px icon"></i></a> or we <a href="http://silviaundtim.ch/" target="_blank">travel the world</a> (our German travel diary).</p>

        <p>OH, by the way, while the web is my background and I still love the binary world I've always been curious about working with physical products. I don't have any experience besides designing some furniture and the interior or our off-road camper in SolidWorks. But... if you happen to be a manufacturing company, liked my portfolio and you're looking for a friendly UX dude to do some cool stuff together - let's talk too!</p>
